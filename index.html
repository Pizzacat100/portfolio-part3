                        <p>I am a senior at Box Elder High school. At Box Elder, I took all of their coding classes and
                            took the
                            HTML and CSS class twice. I also go to bridgerland through Box Elders Program. I've taken
                            Business
                            technology, IT, and currently taking Web &amp; Mobile Development. In the Business
                            technology class, I
                            took two courses: Entrepreneurship and an Adobe class. In IT I took a linux course that
                            talked all about
                            how linux works and how to use a Command Line interface instead of a Ghrapical user
                            interface. I have
                            also taken a summer course in HTML with Code to Success. In that class I made a simple
                            website. </p>

                        <p>I have had only 1 job in my life, I work at Maverik. Maverik is just a gas station, I work in
                            the food
                            section of the gas station. I do not have any work experince in coding nor anything else
                            except food
                            related. Finding jobs that include coding as a seventeen year old is difficult. As with my
                            current job,
                            I work at the maverik in brigham city(technically it's in perry) right next to dary queen. I
                            have worked
                            their for almost two years (1 year and 10 months). Its an ok job but not the best becuase it
                            can
                            sometimes be difficult for me to get off on time. </p>

                        javascript. I also have knowledge in business but thats not really a skill. I feel like I have
                        basic knowledge in Business, and python/javascript coding. I also feel like my knowledge in HTML
                        is higher than the other three.</p>

                    <p>My Interests are coding, business, and videogames. besides videogames, coding and business I
                        belive is my future. I want to learn more in both of them and decide if I want a career in
                        either of them. Coding can be fun for me in certain circumstances like if I start a coding
                        project for myself and not an asignment. Running a business is a dream that ive had for a year,
                        running a business would be fun in the way that it's a new experince and having coding skills
                        would make it a bit easier because i dont have to hire people to make a website or mobile app or
                        whatever.</p>
